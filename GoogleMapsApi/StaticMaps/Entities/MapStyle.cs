	/// Styled maps allow you to customize the presentation of the standard Google map styles, changing the visual display of such elements as roads, parks, and built-up areas to reflect a different style than that used in the default map type. These components are known as features and a styled map allows you to select these features and apply visual styles to their display (including hiding them entirely). With these changes, the map can be made to emphasize particular components or complement content within the surrounding page.
	/// A customized "styled" map consists of one or more specified styles, each indicated through a style parameter within the Static Map request URL. Additional styles are specified by passing additional style parameters. A style consists of a selection(s) and a set of rules to apply to that selection. The rules indicate what visual modification to make to the selection.

Gammas modify the lightness of hues in a non-linear fashion, while unaffecting white or black values. Gammas are typically used to modify the contrast of multiple elements. For example, you could modify the gamma to increase or decrease the contrast between the edges and interiors of elements. Low gamma values (less than 1) increase contrast, while high values (> 1) decrease contrast.
